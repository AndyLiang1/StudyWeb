# Intro from creator: 

Hello! Welcome to the codebase for StudyWeb. The creation of this web application was inspired by the amount of cuecard creating web apps that did not have a timer system implemented. Hence, I decided to make my own.

# Demo:

# Features:

  ## Account

  1) Two factor authentication sign up system with a confirmation email, or sign up by google auth system
  2) Login by manually entering a email and matching passwords, or by google auth system

  ## Folders and sets
  3) Create, store, update, delete folders, which can store sets 
  4) Create, store, update, delete sets, which can store cards
  5) Create, store, update, delete cuecards
  6) Use cuecards
     
  ## Timer
  7) Select preset or custom made timers. Timers have 2 components, a study duration and a break duration. This allows users to follow efficient study techniques such as Pomodoro
  8) Ability to pause, refresh, or delete the timer 
  
  ## Resposiveness
  9) Web application can handle a variety of screen sizes. Navbar collapses into a "hamburger" menu when the screen width becomes small (for example: phones)
